# Open-Closed Principle

- The open-closed principles states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- What it essentially means is that whenever we're adding new functionality, its best to create a new function or class for it, rather than updating the existing one.
- Doing so, has benefits such as reduced regression areas, cleaner code.
